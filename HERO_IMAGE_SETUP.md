# Hero Image Setup Guide

## Adding Your Hero Image

To add your custom hero image to the home page:

1. **Save your image** in the project root directory with one of these names:
   - `hero_image.png`
   - `hero_image.jpg`
   - `hero_image.jpeg`

2. **Recommended image specifications:**
   - **Width**: 1920px or wider
   - **Height**: 500-800px (will be cropped to 500px height)
   - **Format**: PNG, JPG, or JPEG
   - **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or wider works best

3. **The image will automatically:**
   - Fit the full width of the container
   - Display at 500px height
   - Have a gradient overlay with text
   - Be responsive on all screen sizes

4. **If no image is found:**
   - The app will display a beautiful gradient background instead
   - You'll see a helpful tip message
